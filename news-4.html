		It isn’t a secret that humanity and everything around us is made of star stuff. But not all stars create elements equally. 
		Sure, regular stars can create the basic elements: helium, carbon, neon, oxygen, silicon, and iron. But it takes the collision of two neutron stars — 
		incredibly dense stellar corpses — to create the heavier elements like silver, gold, and platinum.
		Neutron stars aren’t just notable for the valuable elements they create, though. 
		They’re also a dream come true for physicists. From their crushing gravity to the universe’s strongest magnetic fields, extremes of 
		physics are the norm for neutron stars. And, unlike black holes, these exotic objects are observable. “It’s hard to study black holes,” says Samar Safi-Harb, 
		the Canada research chair in supernova remanent astrophysics at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada. 
		“With neutron stars, you can do a lot more. You can really probe the interior, there’s a surface you can study, and you can measure a lot of its properties.”
	</p>

		During most of their lifetimes, stars perform a careful balancing act between 
		the inward force of gravity and the outward pressure caused by nuclear fusion in their cores. Eventually, however, 
		a star will run out of material to burn. Stars like the Sun are limited to an initial hydrogen burning phase — the Sun’s will 
		continue for another 4 billion years — followed by a shorter helium burning phase of about 2 billion years.
	</p>

		So, as the outer layers of the star are crushed into the core, 
		the fermions in the star’s center are packed together. 
		The electrons orbiting the nucleus of an atom are the first to feel the squeeze. Unable to be forced any closer together, 
		they produce their own kind of outward pressure, known as electron degeneracy pressure. This halts the progress of gravity, 
		causing the material outside the core to be thrown off. 
		The result is a white dwarf. Ultimately, stars like the Sun will end their life as these stellar remnants.
		For more massive stars, however, gravity wins another battle here. The electrons are squeezed closer and closer 
		to the neutron-proton core of their atom until they merge with the protons, creating more neutrons and some neutrinos. 
		The neutrinos can zip out of the star freely, but the neutrons are crushed closer together until they exert their own gravity-fighting degeneracy pressure, 
		creating a neutron star. In the most extreme cases, gravity overcomes even this force, winning the war and forming a black hole.
