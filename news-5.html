		Black holes are regions of austere darkness, gobbling up everything — even light — that strays too close. But the environment immediately surrounding a black hole is not so dark. 
		Astronomers often spot copious amounts of light streaming from there, emerging from a thin disk of matter called an accretion disk.
		A black hole imprints all of its essential characteristics onto its accretion disk, including its mass, spin, and gravitational field. 
		In the last 10 years, studying the light from such disks has become one of the central methods astronomers use to analyze black holes. 
		And accretion disks supply the only known method for measuring the spin of supermassive black holes, which reside at the center of all large galaxies.
		Perhaps the most exotic message sent to us by a black hole’s accretion disk relates to the gravity it feels. In a study published January 22 in The Astrophysical Journal,
		researchers used X-rays stemming from a black hole’s disk to measure precisely how that black hole’s gravity influences the matter and light nearby. 
		They went on to compare what they found to what they would expect based on Einstein’s well-tested theory of general relativity.
		According to general relativity, black holes only have a few major defining features. Two of these are its mass and its spin. 
		(Black holes may also have a third property: electric charge.) These attributes (and these alone) determine the way that the black hole warps space-time around it. 
		And when physicists study the light coming from a black hole’s accretion disk, they gain the ability to effectively “see” the distant invisible object, potentially 
		unveiling these defining characteristics.

		Sometimes the entangled magnetic field lines snap, releasing an enormous amount of energy. The emerging flare shoots particles and high-energy radiation into space. As the magnetic loops reconnect, they may leave the surface, carrying plasma with them into space as a CME.
		Scientists understand the basic physics of explosive solar phenomena. 
		But the details remain elusive. “What makes it unstable, where does it happen, can we have a certain lead time to predict it?” are all questions researchers are trying to answer, says Astrid Veronig, a solar physicist at the University of Graz in Austria.
		To answer them, historical data can be just as important as fresh observations.
		Drilling down into solar history
		The first flare ever directly detected was also one of the strongest. 
		The 1859 Carrington event wreaked havoc on telegraph networks and led to auroras which, in the northern hemisphere, were visible as far south as the Caribbean. 
		A similarly strong event from 2012 fortunately missed Earth. 
		But such events, while threatening, pale in comparison to superflares on other stars, whose energy outputs can be 10 to 10,000 times stronger. 
		As far as flaring is concerned, the Sun has long been considered a relatively clement star.
		And then, in 2012, scientists discovered that the Sun produced a superflare in A.D. 775 — a revelation that showed the Sun is capable of much more than previously believed.
		The vestiges of such violent solar events lie hidden in the rings of ancient trees and deep under the layers of ice at Earth’s polar caps. When a stream of energetic particles, accelerated by a flare, barges into the Earth’s atmosphere, it sets off a chain of reactions. The collisions between the particles and air molecules create radioactive isotopes (elements with the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons) that eventually settle down all over the planet. The isotopes get absorbed into tree rings, where scientists can search for spikes in isotope concentrations. And because each tree ring corresponds to one year of growth, they can very precisely determine the year each spike occurred.
