          The Sun is an active star. Even at its most quiet, its surface
          trembles and shimmers as if it can barely hold in the contents of its
          hot belly. And when it finally releases that frightening power —
          launching a solar flare or a coronal mass ejection (CME) into
          interplanetary space — we can only hope the blast misses Earth. If it
          doesn’t miss, Earth bears the brunt of the Sun’s fury. This can cause
          our planet to experience strong geomagnetic storms, which may disrupt
          navigational systems, overload power grids, and knock out satellites
          in orbit. The economic costs of a powerful and well-aimed solar
          explosion could add up to billions of dollars per day. Preventing
          potential disaster brought upon us by our closest star will be
          difficult, to say the least. To stand a chance, we have to learn more
          about solar activity. However, the most powerful events are also very
          rare. To understand the extreme end of solar behavior, we need to
          observe the Sun on long timescales — and peer into its distant past.

          Centuries of data The first evidence of solar activity that humans
          noticed was sunspots, with the earliest known records dating to 28
          B.C. in ancient China. Detailed telescopic observations of sunspots go
          back to the 1600s and represent perhaps the longest-running series of
          direct observations of any natural phenomenon. Counting sunspots
          revealed that their numbers change periodically over time in an
          11-year cycle — from virtually zero to tens or even hundreds of spots
          dotting the Sun’s face at once. The record of monthly number of
          sunspots since 1749 reveals how solar activity changes periodically
          over time in an 11-year cycle. The red area represents a moving
          average value. The record of monthly number of sunspots since 1749
          reveals how solar activity changes periodically over time in an
          11-year cycle. The red area represents a moving average value.
          McIntosh et al. 2020 Additional observations from the ground and, in
          the modern era, space-based observatories linked sunspots to magnetic
          fields. The flow of hot plasma within the Sun generates electric
          currents, which in turn generate magnetic fields. Solar rotation
          stretches and twists these fields around the Sun. Sunspots mark the
          regions where magnetic field lines penetrate the surface; the pressure
          they exert cools the gas, making them appear not as bright as their
          surroundings.

          Sometimes the entangled magnetic field lines snap, releasing an
          enormous amount of energy. The emerging flare shoots particles and
          high-energy radiation into space. As the magnetic loops reconnect,
          they may leave the surface, carrying plasma with them into space as a
          CME. Scientists understand the basic physics of explosive solar
          phenomena. But the details remain elusive. “What makes it unstable,
          where does it happen, can we have a certain lead time to predict it?”
          are all questions researchers are trying to answer, says Astrid
          Veronig, a solar physicist at the University of Graz in Austria. To
          answer them, historical data can be just as important as fresh
          observations. Drilling down into solar history The first flare ever
          directly detected was also one of the strongest. The 1859 Carrington
          event wreaked havoc on telegraph networks and led to auroras which, in
          the northern hemisphere, were visible as far south as the Caribbean. A
          similarly strong event from 2012 fortunately missed Earth. But such
          events, while threatening, pale in comparison to superflares on other
          stars, whose energy outputs can be 10 to 10,000 times stronger. As far
          as flaring is concerned, the Sun has long been considered a relatively
          clement star. And then, in 2012, scientists discovered that the Sun
          produced a superflare in A.D. 775 — a revelation that showed the Sun
          is capable of much more than previously believed. The vestiges of such
          violent solar events lie hidden in the rings of ancient trees and deep
          under the layers of ice at Earth’s polar caps. When a stream of
          energetic particles, accelerated by a flare, barges into the Earth’s
          atmosphere, it sets off a chain of reactions. The collisions between
          the particles and air molecules create radioactive isotopes (elements
          with the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons)
          that eventually settle down all over the planet. The isotopes get
          absorbed into tree rings, where scientists can search for spikes in
          isotope concentrations. And because each tree ring corresponds to one
          year of growth, they can very precisely determine the year each spike
          occurred.
